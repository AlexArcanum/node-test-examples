# NodeJS Tests Example

This project is an example project to demonstrate how to write tests in NodeJS. We will look at how to: 

* Test regular NodeJS modules
* Test interactions with the database
* Test API requests 
* Headless browser testing on the server side (with [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/))

## Tools that we'll need

* [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), our testing framework of choice
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) as our assertion library
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) as our ghostly, headless browser testing tool

And of course, I'd assume that you already have some prior experience with awesome tools like [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Request](https://github.com/mikeal/request), [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async) and so forth. If you haven't, go check it out!
